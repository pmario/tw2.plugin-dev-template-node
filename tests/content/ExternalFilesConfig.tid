This tiddler contains the "host" and "list" configuration for [[ajaxLoadExternalFiles.js]]
''host''
<<<
Contains the URL, where the files should be loaded. It should be the same URL where your TW.html file comes from. If it is a different location, the browser may block access because of "Same Origin Policy"

eg: http://localhost:49153/
or: http://example.com/

''Important:'' There must be a trailing slash ''/''!

<<<
''list''
<<<
Is a filename. This file needs to contain a lists of files that should be loaded from the server. If the ServerFileList doesn't exit on the server, the ExternalFiles tiddler will be used as a fallback option. If ServerFileList exists ExternalFiles will be ignored! For a long list, this mechanism will create a lot of single file requests and may take some time!

eg: ServerFileList ... host + list will be ... http://example.com/ServerFileList
or: test/ServerFileList ... host + list will be ... http://example.com/test/ServerFileList
<<<
''log'' level
<<<
If log level is not defined, "count" will be used!

verbose .. (default) Show files loaded and error messages.
error .. Show errors only
count .. Show number of files, that should be loaded.See: ServerFileList 
none .. not supported atm
